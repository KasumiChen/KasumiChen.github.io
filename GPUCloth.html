							<h3>Intro</h3>
							<p>This was originally the mini-project 2 of my course 15664: Technical Animation taken at
								CMU.
								I decided to take this chance to make an actual cloth simulation system usable for my
								future games.
							</p>
							<p>
								The project demostrate my understanding in Unity development, GPU architecture and
								programming
								as well as my mathmatical background in physics simulation.

							<h3>Cloth Model</h3>
							<p>The cloth simulation is based on mass spring system, with 3 types of spring-drag pairs
								shown by the graph on the right:

							<h3>Handling Collisions and Pins</h3>
							<p>I implemented GPU based collision detection using ray-object intersection detection.
								It currently supports unity's inherent sphere objects and can read the transform
								automatically from the sphere.
								The ray is derived from the current and next position of a vertex. If the ray reaches to
								the inside of the sphere, I calculate P and bring the vertex back to P. I also reflect
								the velocity based on surface normal and multiply with Cor for energy loss; Pins are
								special spheres that can fix the position of vertices within it. With Pins I can achieve
								the flag effect easily.

							<h3>Wind Models</h3>
							<p>I also implemented wind resistance to the cloth based on the aerodynamics equations,where
								the velocity is the relative velocity between the vertex and the wind, and the A value
								is the surface area x sine of the wind angle. The parameter WindVelocity specifies the
								to properties.

						<h3>Integrators</h3>
						<p>I implemented four different integrators: Euler, Implicit Euler, Leap Frog and Verlet

							While all the other three works fine, the Euler has random bugs. I located it at the vertex
							(0,0,0) in local space. I found I have to put a pin or a collider there (basically to either
							remove it from integration process or push it aside to make the value non-zero). Otherwise,
							the values will quickly become NaN. I suspect there is some divide by zero bug, but I still
							have not locate it. (GPU program is too hard to debug as I'll mention later.)
						</p>

						<h3>GPU Parallelization</h3>
						<p>Unity uses "Compute Shader" for GPU coding and use "Compute Buffer" for GPU-CPU
							communication. Unlike "Surface Shaders" that only run within a render pipeline, the Compute
							Shader allows us to execute whatever code we want on GPU. As Unity is notoriously infamous
							for its poor documentation and it was the first time for me to use it, I went through all
							the videos and forums for tutorials, and also read through a bunch of GPU codes on Github
							for reference.... </p>
						<p>
							On CPU side, it initializes the mesh and the parameters, packs them up and sends the data to
							GPU for calculation. Then it retrieves the data to update the mesh.

							On GPU side, I created three Kernels: the cloth model kernel, the wind resistance kernel and
							the integrator kernel, where the integrator kernel also handles collisions. The reason for
							that is the wind resistance kernel requires different number of threads (#triangles) than
							the other two (#vertices).
						</p>
						<p>

							For buffers, I created position buffer, force buffer, velocity buffer and triangle buffer
							for each type of data, Also Collider and pin buffer to dynamically change the state of
							colliders and pins in runtime.
							<br>
							As the GPU program knows only the "current state" of vertices, I also added a custom buffer
							for storing preview state of either acceleration or position required by leap-frog and
							Verlet integrators.
						</p>

						<p>

							GPU programs are hard to code but harder to debug, as you can do print on GPU side, it does
							not have memory protection and not telling you about segment fault sometimes.... what's
							worse, there are lots of floating-point errors and corner cases..... I have to do static
							analysis and figure out the cause of the bug manually.

							<br>

							I found I have a lot of if/else in my code but I heard it's not a good practice to use them
							in GPU code. So, to further optimize the code I tried to limit the use of if/else, or use if
							{...} return; instead of if{...}else{...}return. It is because, after some research I found
							the reason for not using if/else is that GPU does not do branching, a thread entering the
							"else" part will wait for others to finish executing the "if" part, the others will wait the
							thread again for the "else" execution. Therefore using if/else lowers the performance by
							half but only having a if{}return is fine, as the threads do not need to wait each other in
							turns.
